Hi all,

Welcome to my website. Often I encounter new models or estimation techniques in the scholarly literature which are potentially useful for me. However, the burden to code that new model can be high: it simply requires time. With this website I hope to lower that burden for  researchers  and  practitioners interested to see whether recent RRM models and methods can be useful for them.

Under the tab |[RRM models & Software](https://github.com/sandervancranenburgh/advancedRRMmodels/RRM%20models%20%26%20Software)| you can find code to estimate:

-   [P-RRM](https://github.com/sandervancranenburgh/advancedRRMmodels/RRM%20models%20%26%20Software/P-RRM) 
-   [Î¼RRM](https://github.com/sandervancranenburgh/advancedRRMmodels/RRM%20models%20%26%20Software/%C2%B5RRM)
-   [G-RRM](https://github.com/sandervancranenburgh/advancedRRMmodels/G-RRM)
-   [RRM2010](https://github.com/sandervancranenburgh/advancedRRMmodels/RRM%20models%20%26%20Software/RRM2010)
-   [RRM2008](https://github.com/sandervancranenburgh/advancedRRMmodels/RRM%20models%20%26%20Software/RRM2008)
-   [Latent class models](https://github.com/sandervancranenburgh/advancedRRMmodels/RRM%20models%20%26%20Software/Latent%20class%20models), comprising of RUM and RRM classes

Software code is available for commonly software packages:

-   [PANDAS BIOGEME](http://biogeme.epfl.ch/)
-   [Apollo R](http://www.apollochoicemodelling.com/)
-   PYTHON BIOGEME
-   BISON BIOGEME
-   [MATLAB](http://nl.mathworks.com/products/matlab/)
-   [LatentGOLD CHOICE](http://www.statisticalinnovations.com/)


Under the tab |[More RRM methodology](https://github.com/sandervancranenburgh/advancedRRMmodels/More)| you can find recently developed RRM methodology, dealing with:

-   Software for creating robust efficient stated choice experimental designs  (new)
-   [Profundity of regret](https://github.com/sandervancranenburgh/advancedRRMmodels/More%20RRM%20methodology/Profundity%20of%20regret)
-   [Accounting for variation in choice set size in RRM models](https://github.com/sandervancranenburgh/advancedRRMmodels/More%20RRM%20methodology/Variation%20in%20choice%20set%20size)
-   [Robustness of RRM modelling outcomes towards omitted attributes](https://github.com/sandervancranenburgh/advancedRRMmodels/More%20RRM%20methodology/Robustness%20of%20RRM%20modes)
